# Maze-E | The Maze Solving Robot ðŸ¤–
An Arduino based two wheeled robot that follows a line and also avoids dead ends to solve a maze. <br>
Full explanation and reasons behind various design choices (eg: why 2 wheels and not 4) are explained below. <br>
p.s. I named it after Wall-E :)

Above video shows a timelapse of it solving a maze I built. Please note that the Ultrasonic sensor and the LCD screen are additional components for other purposes and are not necessary for Maze-E to perform. The code sections responsible for them have been removed from the code. 

Components Used
--------

1. Arduino Uno (any basic arduino board should work)
2. 2WD round robot diy chassis kit
3. L298N motor driver
4. 5 IR sensors (sensor placement explained below)
5. 18650 3.7v batteries (2 is sufficient but 3 is optimal)
6. 18650 Battery holder
